About:   Apply fixed-threshold filters.
Usage:   bcftools filter [options] <in.vcf.gz>

Options:
    -e, --exclude <expr>          exclude sites for which the expression is true (see man page for details)
    -g, --SnpGap <int>            filter SNPs within <int> base pairs of an indel
    -G, --IndelGap <int>          filter clusters of indels separated by <int> or fewer base pairs allowing only one to pass
    -i, --include <expr>          include only sites for which the expression is true (see man page for details
    -m, --mode [+x]               "+": do not replace but add to existing FILTER; "x": reset filters at sites which pass
    -o, --output <file>           write output to a file [standard output]
    -O, --output-type <b|u|z|v>   b: compressed BCF, u: uncompressed BCF, z: compressed VCF, v: uncompressed VCF [v]
    -r, --regions <region>        restrict to comma-separated list of regions
    -R, --regions-file <file>     restrict to regions listed in a file
    -s, --soft-filter <string>    annotate FILTER column with <string> or unique filter name ("Filter%d") made up by the program ("+")
    -S, --set-GTs <.|0>           set genotypes of failed samples to missing (.) or ref (0)
    -t, --targets <region>        similar to -r but streams rather than index-jumps
    -T, --targets-file <file>     similar to -R but streams rather than index-jumps
