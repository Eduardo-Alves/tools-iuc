About:   SNP/indel variant calling from VCF/BCF. To be used in conjunction with samtools mpileup.
         This command replaces the former "bcftools view" caller. Some of the original
         functionality has been temporarily lost in the process of transition to htslib,
         but will be added back on popular demand. The original calling model can be
         invoked with the -c option.
Usage:   bcftools call [options] <in.vcf.gz>

File format options:
   -o, --output <file>             write output to a file [standard output]
   -O, --output-type <b|u|z|v>     output type: 'b' compressed BCF; 'u' uncompressed BCF; 'z' compressed VCF; 'v' uncompressed VCF [v]
   -r, --regions <region>          restrict to comma-separated list of regions
   -R, --regions-file <file>       restrict to regions listed in a file
   -s, --samples <list>            list of samples to include [all samples]
   -S, --samples-file <file>       PED file or a file with optional second column for ploidy (0, 1 or 2) [all samples]
   -t, --targets <region>          similar to -r but streams rather than index-jumps
   -T, --targets-file <file>       similar to -R but streams rather than index-jumps

Input/output options:
   -A, --keep-alts                 keep all possible alternate alleles at variant sites
   -f, --format-fields <list>      output format fields: GQ,GP (lowercase allowed) []
   -g, --gvcf <minDP>              output gVCF blocks of homozygous REF calls
   -i, --insert-missed             output also sites missed by mpileup but present in -T
   -M, --keep-masked-ref           keep sites with masked reference allele (REF=N)
   -V, --skip-variants <type>      skip indels/snps
   -v, --variants-only             output variant sites only

Consensus/variant calling options:
   -c, --consensus-caller          the original calling method (conflicts with -m)
   -C, --constrain <str>           one of: alleles, trio (see manual)
   -m, --multiallelic-caller       alternative model for multiallelic and rare-variant calling (conflicts with -c)
   -n, --novel-rate <float>,[...]  likelihood of novel mutation for constrained trio calling, see man page for details [1e-8,1e-9,1e-9]
   -p, --pval-threshold <float>    variant if P(ref|D)<FLOAT with -c [0.5]
   -P, --prior <float>             mutation rate (use bigger for greater sensitivity) [1.1e-3]
   -X, --chromosome-X              haploid output for male samples (requires PED file with -s)
   -Y, --chromosome-Y              haploid output for males and skips females (requires PED file with -s)
