About:   Create intersections, unions and complements of VCF files.
Usage:   bcftools isec [options] <A.vcf.gz> <B.vcf.gz> [...]

Options:
    -c, --collapse <string>       treat as identical records with <snps|indels|both|all|some|none>, see man page for details [none]
    -C, --complement              output positions present only in the first file but missing in the others
    -e, --exclude <expr>          exclude sites for which the expression is true
    -f, --apply-filters <list>    require at least one of the listed FILTER strings (e.g. "PASS,.")
    -i, --include <expr>          include only sites for which the expression is true
    -n, --nfiles [+-=]<int>       output positions present in this many (=), this many or more (+), or this many or fewer (-) files
    -o, --output <file>           write output to a file [standard output]
    -O, --output-type <b|u|z|v>   b: compressed BCF, u: uncompressed BCF, z: compressed VCF, v: uncompressed VCF [v]
    -p, --prefix <dir>            if given, subset each of the input files accordingly, see also -w
    -r, --regions <region>        restrict to comma-separated list of regions
    -R, --regions-file <file>     restrict to regions listed in a file
    -t, --targets <region>        similar to -r but streams rather than index-jumps
    -T, --targets-file <file>     similar to -R but streams rather than index-jumps
    -w, --write <list>            list of files to write with -p given as 1-based indexes. By default, all files are written

Examples:
   # Create intersection and complements of two sets saving the output in dir/*
   bcftools isec A.vcf.gz B.vcf.gz -p dir

   # Filter sites in A and B (but not in C) and create intersection
   bcftools isec -e'MAF<0.01' -i'dbSNP=1' -e - A.vcf.gz B.vcf.gz C.vcf.gz -p dir

   # Extract and write records from A shared by both A and B using exact allele match
   bcftools isec A.vcf.gz B.vcf.gz -p dir -n =2 -w 1

   # Extract records private to A or B comparing by position only
   bcftools isec A.vcf.gz B.vcf.gz -p dir -n -1 -c all
