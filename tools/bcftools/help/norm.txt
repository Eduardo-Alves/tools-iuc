About:   Left-align and normalize indels; check if REF alleles match the reference;
         split multiallelic sites into multiple rows; recover multiallelics from
         multiple rows.
Usage:   bcftools norm [options] <in.vcf.gz>

Options:
    -c, --check-ref <e|w|x>           check REF alleles and exit (e), warn (w), exclude (x) bad sites [e]
    -D, --remove-duplicates           remove duplicate lines of the same type.
    -f, --fasta-ref <file>            reference sequence
    -m, --multiallelics <-|+>[type]   split multiallelics (-) or join biallelics (+), type: snps|indels|both|any [both]
    -o, --output <file>               write output to a file [standard output]
    -O, --output-type <b|u|z|v>    b: compressed BCF, u: uncompressed BCF, z: compressed VCF, v: uncompressed VCF [v]
    -r, --regions <region>            restrict to comma-separated list of regions
    -R, --regions-file <file>         restrict to regions listed in a file
    -s, --strict-filter               when merging (-m+), merged site is PASS only if all sites being merged PASS
    -t, --targets <region>            similar to -r but streams rather than index-jumps
    -T, --targets-file <file>         similar to -R but streams rather than index-jumps
    -w, --site-win <int>              buffer for sorting lines which changed position during realignment [1000]
