About:   Merge multiple VCF/BCF files from non-overlapping sample sets to create one multi-sample file.
         Note that only records from different files can be merged, never from the same file. For
         "vertical" merge take a look at "bcftools norm" instead.
Usage:   bcftools merge [options] <A.vcf.gz> <B.vcf.gz> [...]

Options:
        --force-samples                resolve duplicate sample names
        --print-header                 print only the merged header and exit
        --use-header <file>            use the provided header
    -f, --apply-filters <list>         require at least one of the listed FILTER strings (e.g. "PASS,.")
    -i, --info-rules <tag:method,..>   rules for merging INFO fields (method is one of sum,avg,min,max,join) or "-" to turn off the default [DP:sum,DP4:sum]
    -l, --file-list <file>             read file names from the file
    -m, --merge <string>               allow multiallelic records for <snps|indels|both|all|none|id>, see man page for details [both]
    -o, --output <file>                write output to a file [standard output]
    -O, --output-type <b|u|z|v>        'b' compressed BCF; 'u' uncompressed BCF; 'z' compressed VCF; 'v' uncompressed VCF [v]
    -r, --regions <region>             restrict to comma-separated list of regions
    -R, --regions-file <file>          restrict to regions listed in a file
