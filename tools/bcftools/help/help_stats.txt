About:   Parses VCF or BCF and produces stats which can be plotted using plot-vcfstats.
         When two files are given, the program generates separate stats for intersection
         and the complements. By default only sites are compared, -s/-S must given to include
         also sample columns.
Usage:   bcftools stats [options] <A.vcf.gz> [<B.vcf.gz>]

Options:
    -1, --1st-allele-only              include only 1st allele at multiallelic sites
    -c, --collapse <string>            treat as identical records with <snps|indels|both|all|some|none>, see man page for details [none]
    -d, --depth <int,int,int>          depth distribution: min,max,bin size [0,500,1]
    -e, --exons <file.gz>              tab-delimited file with exons for indel frameshifts (chr,from,to; 1-based, inclusive, bgzip compressed)
    -f, --apply-filters <list>         require at least one of the listed FILTER strings (e.g. "PASS,.")
    -F, --fasta-ref <file>             faidx indexed reference sequence file to determine INDEL context
    -i, --split-by-ID                  collect stats for sites with ID separately (known vs novel)
    -r, --regions <region>             restrict to comma-separated list of regions
    -R, --regions-file <file>          restrict to regions listed in a file
    -s, --samples <list>               list of samples for sample stats, "-" to include all samples
    -S, --samples-file <file>          file of samples to include
    -t, --targets <region>             similar to -r but streams rather than index-jumps
    -T, --targets-file <file>          similar to -R but streams rather than index-jumps
    -u, --user-tstv <TAG[:min:max:n]>  collect Ts/Tv stats for any tag using the given binning [0:1:100]
    -v, --verbose                      produce verbose per-site and per-sample output
