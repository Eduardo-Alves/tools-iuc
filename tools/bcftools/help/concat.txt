About:   Concatenate or combine VCF/BCF files. All source files must have the same sample
         columns appearing in the same order. Can be used, for example, to
         concatenate chromosome VCFs into one VCF, or combine a SNP VCF and an indel
         VCF into one. The input files must be sorted by chr and position. The files
         must be given in the correct order to produce sorted VCF on output unless
         the -a, --allow-overlaps option is specified.
Usage:   bcftools concat [options] <A.vcf.gz> [<B.vcf.gz> [...]]

Options:
   -a, --allow-overlaps           First coordinate of the next file can precede last record of the current file.
   -D, --remove-duplicates        Output only once records present in multiple files.
   -f, --file-list <file>         Read the list of files from a file.
   -l, --ligate                   Ligate phased VCFs by matching phase at overlapping haplotypes
   -q, --min-PQ <int>             Break phase set if phasing quality is lower than <int> [30]
   -o, --output <file>            Write output to a file [standard output]
   -O, --output-type <b|u|z|v>    b: compressed BCF, u: uncompressed BCF, z: compressed VCF, v: uncompressed VCF [v]
   -r, --regions <region>         restrict to comma-separated list of regions
   -R, --regions-file <file>      restrict to regions listed in a file
