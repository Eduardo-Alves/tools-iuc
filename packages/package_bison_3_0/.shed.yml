long_description: "Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated\
  \ context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing\
  \ LALR(1) parser tables. As an experimental feature, Bison can also generate IELR(1)\
  \ or canonical LR(1) parser tables. \r\nOnce you are proficient with Bison, you\
  \ can use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple\
  \ desk calculators to complex programming languages.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/bison/\r\
