    ONTO-PERL a collection of PERL modules for dealing with OBO-formatted
    ontologies (like the Gene Ontology). This code distribution gathers
    object-oriented modules (for dealing with ontology elements such as Term,
    Relationship and so forth), scripts (for typical tasks such as format
    conversions; obo2owl, owl2obo; besides, there are also many examples that can
    be easily adapted for specific applications), and a set of test files to
    ensure the suite's implementation quality.
