long_description: "GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended\
  \ for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution\
  \ of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments.\
  \ It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation.\
  \ Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it\
  \ can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite\
  \ similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/octave/"
